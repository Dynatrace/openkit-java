# Supported OpenKit Java versions

The following table gives an overview of supported OpenKit Java versions.

As OpenKit applies the principles of [semantic versioning][semver] only the latest bugfix
releases are actively maintained for a major-minor version pair.  
Example: Version `1.4.3` supersedes `1.4.2` and therefore only `1.4.3` will be maintained.
