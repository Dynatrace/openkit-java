# Contributing to Dynatrace OpenKit
Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Dynatrace OpenKit!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. In this document you will find a high level
overview how you can contribute.  

Before making your first contribution, please read our [Code of Conduct][code_of_conduct].

## Having questions?
Your comments, feedback and questions are welcome, and we, the development team, provide answers on multiple channels.

If you do not have access to Dynatrace internal Slack, search for tickets on [GitHub issues][gh-issues] or report new ones.  
If you do have access to Dynatrace internal Slack, you can use the public channel `#team-openkit` for questions.

## Reporting Issues
### Security issues
In case you found a security issue, please do not file a public ticket, but rather contact us directly
via [openkit@dynatrace.com][mail] and send us your findings.

### Bugs
If you have found an issue with OpenKit, which is not security related, you can send us a bug report
either via [GitHub issues][gh-issues] or via the [Dynatrace support portal][dt-support].

## Contributing code
### GitHub Flow
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow][gh-flow]). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the changes build and tests are passing.  
   See [Building OpenKit Java][building] for detailed instructions.
5. Issue that pull request!
